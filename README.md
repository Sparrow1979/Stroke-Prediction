Project name:Leading the Stroke Preventing Lifestyle. Stroke prediction

The goal of this project is to define life style choices that should help prevent the stroke. In addition, I will create and deploy stroke prediction app with Streamlit. 

In addition, this project aims to:
1.	Practice identifying opportunities for data analysis, raising hypothesis, and formulating research tasks.
2.	Practice performing EDA, statistical inference, and prediction.
3.	Practice visualizing data.
4.  Practice machine learning modeling techniques.
5.  Practicing deploying the model for production.
